        <h2>1. What Flashly is</h2>
        <p className="mt-3">
          Flashly is a free study tool that helps you make and practise
          flashcards. It can generate cards with AI, but it is a learning aid,
          not a source of professional, legal, medical or financial advice.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>2. Using Flashly</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Use Flashly lawfully and respectfully.</li>
          <li>
            Only add content you have the right to use, and avoid pasting
            personal, confidential or sensitive information about yourself or
            other people.
          </li>
          <li>
            Don’t try to break, overload or misuse the service, including
            automated scraping or attempts to bypass its limits.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>3. Accounts</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>An account is optional. Flashly works without one.</li>
          <li>You must be at least 13 years old to create an account.</li>
          <li>
            Give an email address you control and keep your password private.
            You are responsible for activity on your account.
          </li>
          <li>
            You must accept these terms and the Privacy Policy to create an
            account. We keep a record of which version you accepted and when.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>4. Your content</h2>
        <p className="mt-3">
          The sets you create are yours. By using Flashly you allow it to store
          your content on your device (and in your account, if you sign in) and
          to send the text you submit to AI providers so they can generate cards
          and explanations. If you create a share link, anyone who has the link
          can read that set.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>5. Community, profiles and messages</h2>
        <p className="mt-3">
          If you have an account you can create a profile, share study sets
          with the community, like other members’ sets and message other
          members. By doing so you agree to the following.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Public means public to members.</strong> Your username,
            display name, photo, bio and interests, and any set you publish as
            public, can be seen by other signed-in members. Sets you publish as
            private are visible only to you.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Be kind.</strong> Don’t post or send anything unlawful,
            hateful, harassing, sexual, violent, deceptive, or that infringes
            someone else’s rights. Don’t spam, impersonate people, or share
            other people’s private information.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Your content stays yours.</strong> You allow Flashly to
            store and show what you publish to the people you choose, and other
            members may save a copy of a public set to their own library.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Messages are not end-to-end encrypted.</strong> They are
            stored so you and the other person can read them. Don’t share
            passwords, financial details or other sensitive information.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Safety tools.</strong> You can block and report people and
            sets. Content that several members report may be hidden
            automatically. We may remove content or suspend accounts that break
            these rules, but we can’t promise to review everything quickly.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Younger members.</strong> You must be at least 13. If you
            tell us you are under 18, direct messages are switched off by
            default. Please talk to a trusted adult if anything online makes you
            uncomfortable.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <section>
        <h2>6. AI-generated content</h2>
        <p className="mt-3">
          AI can be wrong, incomplete or out of date. Check generated cards
          against reliable sources before you rely on them, especially for exams
          or anything with real-world consequences.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>7. Availability and your data</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Flashly is provided “as is”, with no promise that it will always be
            available, error-free, or free of limits.
          </li>
          <li>
            Features and free-tier AI limits can change, and the service may
            stop at any time.
          </li>
          <li>
            Without an account, your sets live only in your browser and are lost
            if you clear site data. Use Backup or an account to keep a copy.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>8. Liability</h2>
        <p className="mt-3">
          To the extent the law allows, Flashly and its maker are not liable for
          any loss arising from your use of the app, including lost data or
          reliance on AI-generated content. Nothing in these terms limits
          rights you have by law that cannot be limited.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>9. Changes and contact</h2>
        <p className="mt-3">

          and you may be asked to accept them again. Questions or concerns?
